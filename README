An attempt for a Perl implementation of the docopt <https://github.com/docopt/docopt>
Python module by Vladimir Keleshev which makes command line interfaces really easy to make.
It's not a straight port (I wouldn't know how to do that) but instead it uses the
parser generator module Parse::RecDescent <https://metacpan.org/module/Parse::RecDescent>
for the parsing which is probably a good thing.

Currently nothing seems to work all the 162 tests fail, at least it gives some idea how
bad the implementation actualy is =).
