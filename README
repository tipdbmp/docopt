An attempt for a Perl implementation of the `docopt <https://github.com/docopt/docopt>`_
Python module by Vladimir Keleshev which makes command line interfaces really easy to make.
It's not a straight port (I wouldn't know how to do that) but instead it uses the
parser generator module `Parse::RecDescent <https://metacpan.org/module/Parse::RecDescent>`_
for the parsing which is probably a good thing.

Currently only the usage section can be parsed. The '...' (ellipsis, aka one or more elements)
are not handled. The other constructs should kind of work, hopefully... It's not a module yet
but a "what's going on script" with lots of debugging messages.
